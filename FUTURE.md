# Reactions

For reactions, I will need to edit the chat log function in order for it to record reasctions, i will also have to make a reaction table that 
lists all the possible reactions. I will add a get message reactions, add reaction, and delete reaction function

# Threaded conversation

For thread conversations, I will need to create a new table called threaded conversations with 2 columns, chat_log message and any message that would be threaded. I will create a get_threaded_message function that returns the threaded messages from the columns
